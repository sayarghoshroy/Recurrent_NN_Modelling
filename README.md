#### Non-Recurrent Model [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayarghoshroy/Recurrent_NN_Modelling/blob/master/sequence_modeling_with_LP.ipynb)

- Modeling sequence as a function that maps term index to the term value.
- The model observes a set of 2500 terms from the sequence and predicts the next 500.
- A simple one-layer perceptron with `d` hidden layers is used as the model.
